# 证书轮换失败

cert-manager reports a warning event that certificate 'packageserver-service-cert' is not renewed

## Cause
- The certificate is managed by olm-operator instead of cert-manager, which only monitors it without renewal operations

## Resolution
- Ignore the warning as it's an expected behavior by design

## [workaround]
- Manually delete secret with 'kubectl get secrets -n cpaas-system packageserver-service-cert --backup && kubectl delete secrets -n cpaas-system packageserver-service-cert' to trigger operator's reissuance

## [Related Information]
- Environment: 3.14.1

- olm-operator
- cpaas-system namespace
