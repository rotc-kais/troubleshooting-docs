# harbor镜像拉取失败

Failed to pull image with error: unauthorized to access repository, action: pull Multiple imagePullSecrets exist in the namespace

## Cause
- Old imagePullSecret's annotation contains incorrect permission path (e.g. /st-rcsp/)
- Newly synced secret lacks required project permissions in annotation

## Resolution
- Delete old secrets starting with integration card name and let system regenerate new ones
- Compare annotations between old/new secrets to validate permission paths

## [workaround]
